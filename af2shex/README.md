# AFShEx

This code was intended to automatically generate the ShEx files from the Excel sheets. Nevertheless, at the end this approach was no longer necessary and we opted to do the conversion manually.

Although the code is no longer needed for the project. We keep it for historical reasons and in case it is considered interesting to explore the idea of generating the ShEx files from the Excel sheets automatically.

## Building

The code was written in Scala and required [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) to build it and generate a standalone executable.
